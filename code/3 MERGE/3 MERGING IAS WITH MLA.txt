1. Right now, if the district changes state (like Adilabad from AP to TL)
it continues to be matched for AP. For eg, adilabad is in AP after 2014 also
but in reality Adilabad is not present in AP after 2014. 
This happens as we are expanding on a unconditional grid at dist+st level
and then merging with IAS data only on district level. 

2. 18% of dist_name obs are missing from ae_win_nobypoll

3. The matching of IAS collector records is far from good atm. Either it is because
the Supremo data base had district info missing or my merge which is 
just on "office" variable got messed up for some obs. 
Either way the solution is to go down till district level website to pull out records
For eg :
View(matched_collector_df %>% filter(office=="bijapur"))
This is in Chattisgarh, https://bijapur.gov.in/en/list-of-collectors/
And the final merged data that I have contains only 3 of the 9 collectors. 


4. Note on: filter(cadre_st==st_name)
So, I finally bit the bullet and did the filter on matched_collector_df
I think its mostly new states where this does not hold + Delhi. 
For new states, it remains to be seen if this is an indicating of some 
missclassification or merge fail that cadre and state are not alligned. 
But for now, moving on. (Jan 2025)


5. Comparison with ge_ias

The time series at state+district is much sparse in ae_ias compared to ge_ias
That is, there are large number of holes in the ae data, but not in the ge data for the 
same state+district units. Ideally this should not be so. 

# 1. THere are more districts_months for Karnataka in AE than in GE for years 
# around 1998-2002 ish, most for 2000. 
# 2. THere are more districts_months for Maha in AE than in GE for years 
# around 2013-2017


6. Might be a repeat. But the new state/district messes up the 
district level year_month grid I create. This is because I just 
create a common grid for whole time period. 


7. AC-PC-DIST MAPPING
Need to revisit. FOr eg, district=="Bahraich" only appears with delim 4
but the distrist is old and its constituents appear in delim 3 with other district. 
It might be that AC/PC moved around.. but there must be some AC/PC in this district 
too in delim3. 
All together the point being, need to revisit with fresh eyes. 
There is significant prob that there is some bug in there. 


8. Note about pc01_state_id and pc01_district_id

Ideally it might have been good to use these variables, but perhaps 
they are not ready yet. The problem might be that they are probably 
indirectly through pc_id and since PC can cross district boundaries, 
they often carry two districts with them and in merging through them
you can get a situation that one ac is tagged with two pc01_districts. 
"TECHNICALLY" this is not allowed as one AC is supposed to be contained
within a district boundary. 
Now, I dont know if this is an error on my part or some artificat of some 
legal merge. 
Regardless, best not to use these codes atm.
