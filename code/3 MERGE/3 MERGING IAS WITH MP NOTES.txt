1. Looking at raw count of PC election around 1989-1999, 
the period was marked with intense political destabalization in India and 
with fall of congress, coalition politics started to emerge.It took some time
to mature. 

2. When merging the QH data with GE election data, there are around 54 merge failiure. 
mm=qcount_df %>% inner_join(ge_win,
                            by=c("party","constituency"="constituency_name", 
                                 "ls_number"="assembly_no", 
                                 "state"="state_name"))
                                 
Reasons include, AP/Telangana mismatch, constituency DNE in one of the data (South Goa), 
by-elections data absent in election data etc
