source(https://ramseraph.github.io/opendata/lgd/)

1. the admin_unit files are maybe useless (the one which has department). 
  Different states have classified 
  different things as "department" and therefore prolly not much meaning to 
  cross sectional difference. For eg, in HR "Police Office" is also a dept. 
  However, perhaps both the org_unit and admin_units can be combined to create the whole. 
  
  
  
  
  
  
# Rajasthan State Govt Structure

(source: https://rajkaj.rajasthan.gov.in/reports.php)

1. RJ seem to have good digital record of a lot of things. (aside, using cgpt I have tried 
to collate some links for all the other states that might have similar info available. 
Look at the file: State Govt Structure.Rmd)

2. For each district-dept, how many performance reviews were undertaken is available here
(https://va.rajasthan.gov.in/views/PAR/DistrictWiseDetails?%3Aembed=y&%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y)
This is just a count data, but it gives the strength of dept-district in terms of count. 
Therefore this is exactly the intensity of govt at district-dept level.
