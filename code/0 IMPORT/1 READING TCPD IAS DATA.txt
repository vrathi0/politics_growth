# 1 Issues in the raw exp_df file
 1. 211 unique id have only one row with no information (NAs)
 2. Further/additional 1487 unique id have just one row and therefore
 #. the max_lvl variable is 0. Looking at their level_eq for that one row
    it looks like this are rows for officers that started quite recently 
    and therefore as just in their first posting. The data does not have
    enough details about recent cadres. 

 3. Alternatively, 4928 posts/records have level=="Not Available" for 2852 
    officers. Previously I was throwing these posts away but perhaps, I can instead 
    impute these in some way as throwing them away will just create holes in the 
    career trajectory. Might be a solvable problem. 
    
    
# 2. See the following snippet:

bad_id1=ias_df %>% mutate(bad_rec=if_else(month_in_service<0, 1, 0)) %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% mutate(bad_id=max(bad_rec)) %>% ungroup() %>%
  filter(bad_id==1) %>% dplyr::select(id, recruit_type) %>% distinct()

On looking into it now, I see no reason to drop these id. 
   1. These are mostly state recruits, and possibly its their first record
   in the IAS data. For some reason, their start_date is recorded from state data
   base and join_date is created new (I think) and that basically creates
   this situation where month_in_service is negative 
   [median: -44 months, mean: -55 months, max:- months]
   2. These were 2362 ids being removed for no good reason. 
   
   
# 3. Identifying centre deputation
This still remains a bit fuzzy. But thankfully, enough information available 
to create a few diff measures. Key decision is where you mark the success. 
Currently, I am marking being at centre at JS level to be the success. The next 
option, I think is marking at the Director level (this would increase the count 
of officers with success quite a lot).
