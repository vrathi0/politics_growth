## BY ELECTIONS
The variable "poll_no" is greater than 0 indicate that election 
is off-cycle and byelection. This can be useful assuming most byelections are random events generated by death or some sudden event requiring the election. 
This also seem relevant for generating some event for teh beaurocracy. 
However, the ECI still need to call it and the timing can be perhaps manipulated (unlikely, its ECI). 

It seems like that in the AC level data, this variable is all 0 which is wrong data
Looking at the main file, as expected the prob of by-poll is low at around 4.5%. Since 1999, it has happened only 129 times ( 127 of which is the first by poll) across India. 

WHAT I AM DOING: 
1. As an starting option, I am creating a lagged version of it at election-PC level. This will indicate if the current incumbant is elected through by poll or not. 



## No. of time contested

This is through the variable "contested". 
I can take the max of it by pid. 
In the recent sample ( ie post 1999), 73% of the candidates
appear in the data only once (using pid).

 ## Constituency Switching 
 
 Large number of missing in the variable "same_constituency". 
 But in the available data, around 11% of PID has ever switched constituency. 
 

## No of terms served 

Even though elections are competetive, atleast the below stat seem to suggest that after winning election, the probability of winning again seem to increase. 
Perhaps in non-consecutive assembly?

## Switching party

Among all PIDs, only about 963 candidates ever changed the party ( around 3%). 
Among ever winning PID, this % jumps to 12%. That is winning candidates are more likely to change. Not complately fair as winning candidates are also have more time in the data.
