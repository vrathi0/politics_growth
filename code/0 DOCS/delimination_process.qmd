# Delimitation Exercise in India: Detailed Procedures and Methodologies

## I. Constitutional and Legal Framework

1. **Constitutional Amendments**:
   - *Eighty-fourth Amendment Act, 2001* and *Eighty-seventh Amendment Act, 2003* amended Articles 81, 82, 170, 330, and 332.
   - **Impact of Amendments**:
     - Fixed the total number of seats allocated to each State in the House of the People and Legislative Assemblies based on the 1971 Census until the first census after 2026.
     - Reserved seats for SCs and STs to be adjusted according to the 2001 Census.

2. **Delimitation Act, 2002**:
   - Established the Delimitation Commission, amended by the Delimitation (Amendment) Act, 2003.
   - **Commission Structure**:
     - Chairman (Justice Kuldip Singh), Election Commissioner, and State Election Commissioner as ex-officio members.
     - *Associate Members*: Up to five Lok Sabha members and five State Legislative Assembly members from each state, with no voting rights.

## II. Key Objectives of Delimitation
1. **Freezing Constituencies**:
   - Based on the 2001 Census, constituency boundaries will remain unchanged until the first census post-2026.
2. **Equitable Population Distribution**:
   - Aim for population equality across constituencies, “as far as practicable,” using state-specific average population figures.

## III. Constituency Division and Methodology

1. **Division Criteria**:
   - **Assembly and Parliamentary Constituencies**:
     - Allocated based on the current total seats in State Legislatures and the House of the People.
     - Each constituency should cover a geographically compact area, considering physical features, administrative boundaries, and public convenience.

2. **Population Standardization**:
   - **2001 Census Data**: Sole basis for population figures.
   - **State Average Calculation**:
     - Divide the total population by the number of assembly constituencies in a state.
     - Aim for consistency in population across constituencies within a 10% deviation from the state or district average if necessary due to geography or communication issues.

3. **Permissible Deviation**:
   - A deviation of up to 10% plus or minus from the state or district average population is allowed, particularly if geography, communication, and administrative unity demand it.

## IV. Administrative Units and Cut-off Dates
1. **Administrative Alignment**:
   - Delimitation is to follow administrative boundaries as of *February 15, 2004*, using districts, subdivisions, tehsils, patwar circles, panchayat samitis, and panchayats.
   - **Boundary Stability**:
     - States advised not to alter administrative units post-*August 1, 2002*, although specific reorganizations were permitted based on justification.

## V. Methodology for Allocating Assembly Constituencies to Districts
1. **District-Based Allocation Process**:
   - **Confinement within Districts**:
     - Where feasible, each district should contain its own assembly constituencies without crossing into other districts.
   - **Calculation of Seats per District**:
     - Divide each district’s total population by the state’s average population per constituency.
     - Rounding: Fractions over 0.5 are rounded up; those below 0.5 are rounded down.

2. **District Population Standards**:
   - Average population per constituency within a district determined by dividing district population by allocated seats.
   - 10% deviation from district averages is permissible to avoid unnecessary administrative splits.

3. **Geographical Continuity**:
   - Constituencies to maintain contiguous areas, avoiding the creation of enclaves or fragmented sections.

4. **Zig-Zag Method**:
   - Constituency delimitation within each district is generally oriented North to North-East, proceeding in a zig-zag pattern to the South.

## VI. Delimitation of Parliamentary Constituencies
1. **Assembly Constituencies Within Parliamentary Boundaries**:
   - Parliamentary constituencies are composed of whole assembly constituencies within a state.
   - No assembly constituency should span more than one parliamentary constituency.

## VII. Reservation of Seats for SCs and STs
1. **Reservation Criteria**:
   - Seats reserved proportionally for SCs and STs based on their population in the 2001 Census relative to the state’s total population.

2. **Allocation Process**:
   - **For STs**:
     - As per section 9(1)(d) of the Delimitation Act, ST seats are reserved in constituencies with the highest ST population percentages in descending order.
   - **For SCs**:
     - SC reservations are distributed across the state, with preference given to constituencies where SCs represent a higher percentage of the total population.

## VIII. Preparation and Approval of Working Paper
1. **Working Paper Components**:
   - **Seven Key Papers**:
     - *Paper I*: District-wise 2001 population data and assembly seat entitlement.
     - *Paper II*: SC seat entitlement across districts.
     - *Paper III*: Proposed SC constituency allocations.
     - *Paper IV*: Proposed ST constituency allocations.
     - *Paper V*: Summary of proposed constituencies, including total SC and ST populations.
     - *Paper VI*: District-wise statement showing constituency extent, total/SC/ST population.
     - *Paper VII*: Proposed Lok Sabha constituencies and their respective assembly constituencies.

2. **Tentative Approval Process**:
   - **Initial Approval**: Papers I and II, defining seat allocation per district and SC seat distribution, are approved by the Commission before consultation with Associate Members.
   - **Consultation and Feedback**:
     - Associate Members are consulted in subsequent meetings, with Chief Electoral Officers available to clarify data and maps.

## IX. Draft Proposals and Public Involvement
1. **Draft Proposal Publication**:
   - **Gazette and Newspaper Publication**:
     - Draft proposals published in the Gazette of India, relevant State Gazettes, and at least two vernacular newspapers.
     - Public objections and suggestions invited, with a specific deadline for responses.

2. **Public Hearings**:
   - After the deadline, the Commission holds public hearings for additional feedback.

## X. Final Orders
1. **Finalization of Delimitation**:
   - Post-hearing, the Commission meets with Associate Members (non-voting) to consider all suggestions.
   - **Publication of Final Orders**:
     - Final orders signed by the full Commission are published in the Gazette and regional newspapers.
     - Orders take effect on a date specified by the President, with copies submitted to the House of the People and respective State Legislative Assemblies.
