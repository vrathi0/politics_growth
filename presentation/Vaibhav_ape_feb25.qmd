## 

**Research Question**

-   How does political shocks affect bureaucratic efficiency.

-   What are the implication for this for capital formation through regulatory approval.

## Motivation

-   Most countries have various sets of regulations for firm entry, capital investment etc.
-   Spirit is to curb any negative externalities.
-   But, it gives control or discretion to politicians/bureaucrats.

## 

$$K_{t+1}=\delta K_t +\tilde{I_t} $$

$$\tilde{I_t}=(1-\Theta(b_t))I_t$$

($b_t$) is a measure of red tape. It also erodes away the value of investment due to bribe, delays etc.

-   $b_t$ depends on how well the incentives of $P$ and $B$ are aligned.
-   $B$ has much longer horizon, $P$ has shorter horizon but have power to push $B$ to change $b_t$

## Framework

-   **Elite Capture**: "Elites"/big businesses capture the political agenda using lobbying or bribes.
-   **Red Tape-ism**:
    -   It exists to discover information that firms do not have incentive to share.
    -   However, bureaucrat may have incentive to misreport their discovery as most regulations are incomplete/not well designed.
        -   Example: environmental impact assessment, etc

## Existing Litt

-   THE REGULATION OF ENTRY, Djankov 2002
    -   Showed countries with more regulations have lower growth rate.
-   Vishny and Shleifer 1993; Guriev 2004
-   Allesina et al, 2007

## Today:

-   Looks into mechanics of regulatory enforcement using detailed capital investment data.
-   Lengthy regulatory approval process involving several levels of bureaucracy

## Setting

-   Legislative body: elected politicians; 5 year tenure.
-   Administration
    -   Staffed by career bureaucrats, can not be fired.
    -   Famous Indian Administrative Services (carried over from British Raj)
    -   Highly meritocratic; poor incentives; very centralized.

## Data

-   Data on elected representatives.
-   Career trajectory data for bureaucrats: post, location, start and end date
-   CapEx data: Investments aimed to increase prod. capacity.

## CapEx data

-   Investment data, of USD 100k or more.
-   Contains rich time, place and stage of approval.
-   Only available for recent years starting 2002.

## 

-   Year and place information is useful as district bureaucrats are usually tasked with several core tasks like: community meeting/approval, land acquisition, etc
-   No formal involvement of politicians.

## Bureaucrats

-   Levels: District \> State \| Center
-   Start their career at the district level as the apex district administrator.
-   Promotion along the ladder at a regular/"expected" frequency.
-   **Glittering Prize**: After around 16-20 years of service select few are chosen to go work in central ministries in Delhi.

## Bureaucrats

-   Motivated by "good postings".
-   Officers that have postings in "good" departments or who spend more time with senior politicians have higher chance of getting the glittering prize.
-   I dont observe the decision process, only ex-post.

**Iyer and Mani, 2012**: Evidence that caste affinity between politician and bureaucrat is a substitute to bureaucrat's ability.

## Politicians

-   Even though most politicians have limited terms, there is a set of politicians that are very stable and often serve several terms.
-   Without any power to fire, politicians use transfers/less desirable roles.
-   Bureaucratic Transfers: High, a popular policy/public conversation

## 

-   Most transfers happen right **after** elections.
-   If an incumbent win, almost no transfers happen in their district.

## District level descriptive \| Treatment: stable politician leaves the district

-   **Outcome**: Count of all actions recorded in the data \[Mean: 5.6\]

## 

-   **Outcome**: Count of land related actions \[Mean: 0.6\]

## Policy spotlight: new election map starting 2009

-   In 2008, new election districts were drawn. As a result, some district changed their status from **Reserved** to **General** and vice-versa

![](images/Screenshot%202025-02-14%20at%207.28.39%20AM.png){width="269" height="39"}

## 

-   All incumbent in these districts could not run in the 2009 election.
-   Bureaucrats also know this atmost starting 2008 (or earlier?).

## Treatment: Change of reservation status

$$ y_{dt} = \alpha_{dt} + \sum_{t \neq -1} \beta_t \cdot \mathbb{1}(\text{time} = t) \cdot \text{Treatment}_{d} + \text{Treatment}_{d} + \xi_t+ \gamma X_{dt} + \delta_{s} +  \epsilon_{dt} $$

unit: district-year

## Y=Count of all actions

![](images/Screenshot%202025-02-14%20at%205.52.12%20AM.png){width="470"}

\[Mean Y: 4.3\]

## Y= Land related actions
